## 1: Expose the structure of the institutions involved

Registers are infrastructure services. They should make the structure of the system clear.

This involves making clear what institution is currently delivering this register - for example:

_"Provided by The Cabinet Office on behalf of the Department for Education"_

## 2: Make someone responsible, then name that person

Registers should have a single named individual responsible for the contents. The name of
this individual should be published on the register with the contents.

## 3: Encourage communication from users

Registers should include a way to contact the person responsible for managing them at the
point of access.

## 4: Explain the source of authority and trust, don't assert it

Registers are only as useful as they are canonical.

Explaining why this register may be
considered canonical is a key part in establishing this trust amongst consumers of the
contents.

In practical terms, for government registers this will often mean linking to the legislation
underpinning the existence of the register.
